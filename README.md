A java 2D game engine powered by JavaFX.

## 1. Progression

I have a [blog](https://n3roo.github.io/blog.html) on my website where I speak about the last changes.

## 2. Project description

This is my most ambitious project yet. I plan to implement everything that I have learned in Computer Science these last years. I hope that the first version will be released this summer.

**Acknowledgments:**
- Bordeaux Institute of Technology,
- University of Bordeaux.

**Libraries used:**
- Apache : [log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logbackâ€™s architecture.
