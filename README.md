An easy to use java 2D game engine powered by JavaFX 13. ðŸŽ®

## 1. Progression

I have a [blog](https://n3roo.github.io/blog.html) on my website where I speak about the last changes.

## 2. Project description

This is my most ambitious project yet. I plan to implement everything that I have learned in Computer Science these last years. I hope that the first version will be released this summer.

## 5. Set up your environment

### 5.1 Project import

Fork the project. If you use IntelliJ, you need to open the folder as a project.
Then make sure to right click on:
- "src/main/resources" add "Mark Directory as" -> "Resources root",
- "src/main/java", add "Mark Directory as" -> "Sources root",
- "src/test/java", add "Mark Directory as" -> "Test Sources root",
- "src/demo/java", add "Mark Directory as" -> "Sources root",
- "src/demo/resources", add "Mark Directory as" -> "Resources root".
Also, make sure to use Java 13 (File -> Project Structure -> Project SDK: 13 & Language level: 13).

Folders :
- **src/main**: contains the engine source code,
- **src/test**: contains the engine tests,
- **src/demo**: contains a demo game using the engine.

### 5.2 Code coverage & Continuous Integration (CI)

You don't have to do anything concerning the CI.
Regarding code coverage, write `mvn clean test jacoco:report`. Then, from the menu select
Analyze > Show Coverage data. In the new window press the + button and select target/jacoco.exec file.
The test coverage results will appear in the editor Coverage tab.

### 5.3 Execution

**Intellij tools:** Go in `src/demo/java/sample/main/Main` and click on "run Main.main()".

**Maven tools:**
Type `mvn javafx:run`


If there is an error saying `Error: Could not find or load main class sample.main.Main`, it is
probably because you typed `mvn clean`. To fix it, go in IntelliJ, click on Build and then, Rebuild project.
