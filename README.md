A java 2D game engine powered by JavaFX 12.

## 1. Progression

I have a [blog](https://n3roo.github.io/blog.html) on my website where I speak about the last changes.

## 2. Project description

This is my most ambitious project yet. I plan to implement everything that I have learned in Computer Science these last years. I hope that the first version will be released this summer.
