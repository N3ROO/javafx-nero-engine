# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please make sure that the following rules are respected. If the rules are respected,
you are free to change anything you want in the code ! Make a pull request and I will merge it - make sure to explain your changes ! :)

## Coding style
- Variables must be written using camelCase : thisIsMyVariable,
- If an attribute or a variable is final, it should be written THIS_WAY,
- Name the methods using camelCase as well : "itIsSomething()" and not this way "it_is_something()" ,
- The getters must have "get" prefix, and then the exact name of the variable : "getHealth()" for "health",
- If the variable is a boolean, then the getter should be written this way : "isAlive()" for "alive",
- The setters must have "set" prefix, and then the exact name of the variable : "setPosition" for "position".
